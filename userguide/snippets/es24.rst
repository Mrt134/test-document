Become Familiar With the ES24
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ES24 has front panel buttons for power and alarm mute, and
indicators for power, locate ID, and fault. The fault indicator is on
during the initial power-on self-test (POST) or when the %brand%
software has issued an
`alert
<https://support.ixsystems.com/truenasguide/tn_options.html#alert>`__.

Rail Kit Assembly
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Remove Cabinet Rails from Rack Rails
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Extend the cabinet rail until it stops. To remove the cabinet rail,
press the white release tab to the right while pulling the cabinet
rail.

.. _cabinet_rail_removal:
.. figure:: images/truenas/es24_cabinet_rail1.png


Mount Cabinet Rails
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The cabinet rails are mounted on both sides of the system. Align the
cabinet rail keyholes with the three posts on the side of the chassis
and pull the rail until the post is wedged in the smaller hole.


.. _cabinet_rail2:
.. figure:: images/truenas/es24_cabinet_rail2.png


Align the rail holes with the screw holes and secure the rail with
one of the supplied cabinet screws included with the rail kit.
Repeat this process on the other side.


Mount the Rack Rails
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Place the rail in the rack with the front end toward the front of the
rack, aligning the pins with the mounting holes in the front of the
rack. Push the pins into the holes until the latch clicks.

Place one square cage nut with the tabs vertical into the front of
the rack, directly below the top rail pin. Repeat this process on the
other front rail. The cage nuts will later support the screws used to
secure the enclosure to the rack.

For the rear end of the rail, align the pins with the mounting holes
on the rear rack. Pull the white latch toward the rear until the pins
click in place. Repeat this process for the second rear rail.


.. _rack_rail_install:
.. figure:: images/truenas/es24_rack_rail_install.png
   :width: 60%


Mount the Unit in the Rack
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Caution: Two people are required to safely lift the chassis for rack
installation or removal.** Do not install drives until after the
chassis has been installed in the rack, and remove all drives before
removing the chassis from the rack.

Pull the front rack rail forward until it stops. Align the cabinet
rail with the inside of the front rack rail and slide the cabinet rail
forward until it is fully seated inside the rack rail. Repeat the
process for the second rail.


.. _rack_rail_to_cabinet_rail:
.. figure:: images/truenas/es24_cabinet_meets_rack.png
   :width: 60%


When both cabinet rails are secured inside of the rack rails, gently
push the chassis until it stops halfway in. Slide the blue release
tabs on both cabinet rails toward the front of the system while
pushing the unit in until it is flush with the front of the rack.


.. _mount_system_in_rack:
.. figure:: images/truenas/es24_mount_system.png
   :width: 60%


Anchor the unit in the rack on both sides with the screws included in
the rail kit.


Install Drive Trays
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Drive trays are used to mount drives in the array. Each drive tray has
a status LED which is blue when active or amber if a fault has
occurred.

Press the silver button to open the latch. Carefully slide the tray
into a drive bay until the right side of the latch touches the metal
front edge of the chassis, then gently swing the latch closed until it
clicks into place.

Connect Power Cords
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Do not plug the power cords into a power outlet yet.**
Connect a power cord to the back of one power supply. Place the cord
into the plastic clamp and press the tab into the latch to lock it in
place. Repeat the process for the second power supply and cord.

.. _power_cord_connection:
.. figure:: images/truenas/es24_power_cord.png
  :width: 35%


Connect SAS Cables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Plug the ES24 power cords into power outlets.
**Wait two minutes for the drives to start.**


.. note:: The %brand% Unified Array can remain on while the expansion
   shelf is connected.


Connect an SAS cable from ES24 expansion module 1 SAS 0 connector to
the farthest left Z series storage controller 1 SAS connector (cable #1
in photo).

If the Z series has a second storage controller for HA (High
Availability), connect a second SAS cable from ES24 expansion module 2
SAS 0 connector to the farthest left Z series storage controller 2 SAS
connector (cable #2 in photo).

A second ES24 can also be connected to the Z series. Connect the first
ES24 as shown above. Then connect the second ES24 SAS 0 ports to the
next unused SAS ports on the Z series as shown:

   SAS Cable Connection for Two ES24s


After all SAS cables have been connected, plug the Z series power
cords into power outlets.


Install Bezel (Optional)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The included bezel is not required for operation. If desired, install
the bezel by aligning it with the pins on the bezel ears and pressing
it into place.
