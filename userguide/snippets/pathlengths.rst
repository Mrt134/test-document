Names of files, directories, and devices are subject to some limits
imposed by the FreeBSD operating system. The limits shown here are for
names using plain-text characters that each occupy one byte of space.
Some UTF-8 characters take more than a single byte of space, and using
those characters reduces these limits proportionally. System overhead
can also reduce the length of these limits by one or more bytes.

.. note:: 88 bytes is equal to 88 ASCII characters. The number of
   characters varies when using Unicode.


.. warning:: If the mounted path length for a snapshot exceeds 88
   bytes, the data in the snapshot is safe but inaccessible. When
   the mounted path length of the snapshot is less than the 88 byte
   limit, the data will be accessible again.

The 88 byte limit affects automatic and manual snapshot mounts in
slightly different ways:

* **Automatic mount:** ZFS temporarily mounts a snapshot whenever a
  user attempts to view or search the files within the snapshot. The
  mountpoint used will be in the hidden directory
  :file:`.zfs/snapshot/{name}` within the same ZFS dataset. For
  example, the snapshot :file:`mypool/dataset/snap1@snap2` is mounted
  at :file:`/mnt/mypool/dataset/.zfs/snapshot/snap2/`. If the length
  of this path exceeds 88 bytes the snapshot will not be automatically
  mounted by ZFS and the snapshot contents will not be visible or
  searchable. This can be resolved by renaming the ZFS pool or dataset
  containing the snapshot to shorter names (:file:`mypool` or
  :file:`dataset`), or by shortening the second part of the snapshot
  name (:file:`snap2`), so that the total mounted path length does not
  exceed 88 bytes. ZFS will automatically perform any necessary
  unmount or remount of the file system as part of the rename
  operation. After renaming, the snapshot data will be visible and
  searchable again.

* **Manual mount:** The same example snapshot is mounted manually
  from the :ref:`Shell` with :command:`mount -t zfs
  mypool/dataset/snap1@snap2 /mnt/mymountpoint`. The path
  :file:`/mnt/mountpoint/` must not exceed 88 bytes, and the length of
  the snapshot name is irrelevant. When renaming a manual mountpoint,
  any object mounted on the mountpoint must be manually unmounted with
  the :command:`umount` command before renaming the mountpoint. It can
  be remounted afterwards.

.. note:: A snapshot that cannot be mounted automatically by ZFS can
   still be mounted manually from the :ref:`Shell` with a shorter
   mountpoint path. This makes it possible to mount and access
   snapshots that cannot be accessed automatically in other ways, such
   as from the |web-ui| or from features such as "File History" or
   "Versions".
